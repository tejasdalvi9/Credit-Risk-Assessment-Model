# Credit-Risk-Assessment-Model-Using-Spark

Project: Credit Risk Assessment Model Using Spark

Description:
Designed and implemented a robust data processing pipeline using Apache Hadoop (HDFS), Apache Hive, Apache Spark, DataFrame API, PySpark SQL, and PySpark MLlib to predict loan defaults accurately. Leveraged HDFS and Hive for scalable and efficient data storage. Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree. Utilizing Spark MLlib libraries. Evaluated model performance with metrics like ROC-AUC and created dynamic visualizations with Tableau to provide compelling, data-driven insights for financial decision-making.
